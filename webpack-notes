We are using the "electron-webpack" module to create our webpack and allow for hot module reloading.

Additional configuration was added to package.json under "electronWebpack".

In addition, we have a file called "webpack.renderer.additions.js" that gives extra rules for electron-webpack.
More specifically, this file allows for the compilation of React components and jsx files.

Additionally, the "tsconfig.json" file gives additional configuration for the compilation of TS/TSX files.

FUTURE POTENTIAL TASKS:
Add more configuration for sass-loader, node-sass
REVIEW SETUP CONFIGURATION https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder
Update "appId" in "build" in package.json (and also mac category)
Add icons https://www.electron.build/icons
